Version 1.0.0 (10 December 2017):
  - First public release on GitHub as portable jar-file.
  - Implements the official rules of FIDE (Fédération Internationale des
    Échecs) except for en passant moves and the following draw rules:
      1) Threefold repetition: The same position occurs three times with the
         same player to move.
      2) Fifty-moves rule: The last fifty successive moves made by both players
         contain no capture or pawn move.
      3) Insufficient material: Neither player has a theoretical possibility
         to checkmate the opponent.
  - Graphical user interface with chessboard, last move highlighting, status
    message, castling overview and keyboard input for figure selection and
    movement.
  - Menu-bar with support for new game configuration, movement undoing,
    about dialog and shortcuts. Supported are human vs. human or computer
    player games.
  - Computer players are implemented using a common min-max search with
    alpha-beta pruning in combination with a simple scoring-heuristic for
    figure-constellations; the search depth are four half-moves. The following
    implementation constraints are satisfied:
      1) The min-max search is heap memory allocation free. There exist no
         dynamic memory allocations throughout a computer player's turn, for
         which reason computer players have fixed memory requirements. Each
         game situation, including the history of previous and possible moves,
         fits in 32kB.
      2) The min-max implementation is recursive.
